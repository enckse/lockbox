The password store can have the key (and file) changed via the '{{ $.ReKeyCommand }}'
subcommand. This command requires that '{{ $.ReKey.Store }}' is set and
a combination of new key settings are configured via '{{ $.ReKey.Key }}', '{{ $.ReKey.KeyMode }}', and '{{ $.ReKey.KeyFile }}' depending on the new database
credential preferences. The settings correspond to the 'LOCKBOX_'
settings normally used when running `{{ $.Executable }}`.

Note that is an advanced feature and should be used with caution/backups/etc.
