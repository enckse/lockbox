Completions are available for certain shells and, by default, assume all
features of `{{ $.Executable }}` are enabled and available. When changing certain environment
flags it may be useful to change the completion profile to more closely match
the restricted command options, run `{{ $.Executable }} {{ $.HelpCommand }} {{ $.HelpShellCommand }}` for information
on how best to alter completion outputs.
