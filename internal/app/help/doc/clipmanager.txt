The `{{ $.ClipManager }}` functionality allows running a local clipboard
manager for the system that will monitor the clipboard and clear it when
it has been idle for a (configured) period of time. This is specifically
invoked via `{{ $.Executable }} {{ $.ClipManager }}` (and can be killed
by adding `{{ $.ClipManagerStop }}` as an argument).
